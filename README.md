Foresight protocol / 2016 Case study ( you know who )
# Ghost Protocol Dashboard

## Project Description

Ghost Protocol Dashboard is a foresight and contradiction surfacing dashboard built for leadership, ethics, and governance testing in high‑risk organizational environments. It acts as an audit mirror for executive behavior, incentive structures, and misalignment between corporate narrative and operational reality. The dashboard integrates with the Ghost Protocol Reflection Engine and accepts JSON or flat file outputs from sandbox simulations.

## Key Features

- **Score Panel** for tracking Foresight Health, Culture Resilience, and Narrative Alignment.
- **Red Flag Summary** that highlights contradictions such as incentive misalignment or ethical drift.
- **Sandbox Simulation Log** showing reflective prompts and interaction history.
- Designed for integration with the Ghost Protocol Reflection Engine.
- Works with JSON or plain text outputs from sandbox simulations.
- Useful for internal audits, leadership reflection, and governance prototyping.

## Use Cases

- Internal ethics auditing in large enterprises.
- Governance failure scenario testing (e.g. banking, healthcare, defense).
- Preemptive culture and compliance risk mapping.
- Leadership behavior simulation during high‑pressure cycles.
- Corporate contradiction mapping (stated values vs. incentive design).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

}
